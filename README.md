# Honey Bomb
Created by Aksel Taylan and Aren Taylan

This game was developed in under 48 hours to practice for future game jams and coding competitions.

Premise:
Honey Bomb is a 3D first-person exploration game in which you gather honey from around the forest to power your cannon; the cannon being the only weapon powerful enough to take out a colony of alien bees that have taken over the forest. Using pathfinding AI, the bees chase you down with relentless persistence; the only way to slow them down is your bee smoker. Your goal is to fuel your honey-cannon without getting touched by a single bee.

Controls:
-WASD or arrow keys for movement/n
-Hold Space to gather honey / fill the cannon with honey
-Escape to pause the game
-Use the mouse to control the rotation of the camera
-Click on the screen to spray the bee smoker
